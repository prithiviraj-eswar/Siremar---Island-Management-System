            Margarita is a beautiful Island located in South America; it belongs to Venezuela. This island gets its 
budget from Central government based on its population.
Siremar aims to keep a dynamic count of all residents of the Island so that the island can get a stable, 
sound budget from Central Government. The system will require all Residents to register. Registration 
can be online or in our offices. . Siremar will provide an ID and  a lot of  benefits to residents. 
Until the early 20th century, the population of Margarita was predominantly indigenous, with some Spanish ancestry traceable mainly to the Canary Islands. Since 1920 the island has attracted immigrants from abroad, but at the same time many islanders have migrated to the mainland in 
search of more favourable employment.
